	Days in Current  Month

	Write a program that can determine  the number  of days in a month  for a specified month and  year. 
	The program should  allow  a user to enter  two  integers  representing  a month and  a  year,  
	and  it  should  determine  how  many  days  are  in  the  specified  month.  The integers 1 through 
	12 will be used to identify the months  of January  through December. The user indicates the end of 
	input by entering 0 0 for the month  and year. At that point, the program prints  the number  of 
	days in the current  month  and terminates.
	
	
	Use the following criteria to identify leap years:
	1.  A year Y is divisible by 100. Then Y is a leap year if and if only it is divisible by 400.
	For example, 2000 is a leap year but 2100 is not.
	2.  A year Y is not divisible by 100. Then Y is a leap year if and if only it is divisible by 4.
	For example, 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not.

	Here is sample run of the program:

	Enter month and year: 2 2008[Enter]
	29 days
	Enter month and year: 0 0[Enter]
	The current month, September 2009, has 30 days.
