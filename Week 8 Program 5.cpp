	Age

	Write a program that  asks for the user’s name and year of birth,  greets the user by name, and  
	declares  the  user’s age in years.  Users are  assumed  to  be born  between  the  years
	1800  and  2099,  and  should  enter  the  year of birth  in one of the  three  formats  18XX,
	19XX,  or 20XX.  A typical output should  be “Hello  Caroline,  you are 23 years old.”
